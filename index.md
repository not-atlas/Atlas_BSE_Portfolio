# Phone Controlled Robotic Arm
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# First Milestone

**My first milestone was getting my arm built and functioning along with the PS2 controller attached to it. After I got all 4 servos working, I went on to finish the arm itself. A servo works similarly to a motor, but it can only move a certain degree. Meaning that servos work perfectly for things like steering a RC car, or a robotic arm. The arm moves by taking the X and Y inputs of each joystick from the PS2 controler. The signals are then sent to the arduino to move the servos corespondingly. One major challenge that I faced was getting the angle right for the each servo on the arm. Since each servo is set at 90 degrees by default, I need to put on the parts at the right angle for the arm to have full range of motion. For example, if the servo is set at 60 degrees, the actual arm part that goes on the servo needs to be at the same degree as the servo. Otherwise, the joint in the arm will not function properly. The next step for me is to get the app working on the phone, and to add wheels, and a battery pack to the arm.**

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code

**Starter code to get the arm moving with the PS2 controller input**

```c++
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo1;  // create servo object to control a servo
Servo myservo2;
Servo myservo3;
Servo myservo4;
int pos1=90, pos2=90, pos3=90, pos4=90; 

void setup()
{
  myservo1.attach(3);    // set the control pin of servo 1 to 3 digital I/0
  myservo2.attach(5);    // set the control pin of servo 1 to 3 digital I/0
  myservo3.attach(6);    // set the control pin of servo 1 to 3 digital I/0
  myservo4.attach(9);    // set the control pin of servo 1 to 3 digital I/0
  
  myservo1.write(pos1);
  myservo2.write(pos2);
  myservo3.write(pos3);
  myservo4.write(pos4);
  delay(1500);
}

void loop() 
{

  // close the claw 
  for(pos4;pos4>45;pos4--)
  {
    myservo4.write(pos4);
  }
  delay(1000);
  
 // open the claw
 for(pos4;pos4<120;pos4++)
 {
   myservo4.write(pos4);
 }
  delay(1000);

// turn right
  for(pos1;pos1>30;pos1--)
  {
    myservo1.write(pos1);
    delay(5);      // delay 5ms（used to adjust the servo speed）
  }
  delay(1000);

   // turn to left 
  for(pos1;pos1<150;pos1++)
  {
    myservo1.write(pos1);
    delay(5);
  }
  delay(1000);

  //  stretch out the arm
  for(pos2;pos2<130;pos2++)
  {
    myservo2.write(pos2);
    delay(5);
  }
  delay(1000);\

  // retracte the arm
  for(pos2;pos2>80;pos2--)
  {
    myservo2.write(pos2);
    delay(5);
  }
  delay(1000);

  // raise the arm 
  for(pos3;pos3<100;pos3++)
  {
    myservo3.write(pos3);
    delay(5);
  }
  delay(1500);

 // Lower the arm 
  for(pos3;pos3>40;pos3--)
  {
    myservo3.write(pos3);
    delay(5);
  }
  delay(1000);

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
